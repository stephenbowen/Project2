Description:
This repository contains files used to perform a number of functions. gpio.c
configures an RGB LED to toggle. circbuf.c implements a circulatr buffer for
communications purposes. uart.c initializes and handles tx and rx functions.
unittest.c performs tests on memory manipulation and conversion functions.

unittest.c successfully tests the required functions, each of which work
correctly.

uart.c is written but untested. It likely has serious errors and bugs.

project2.c is unwritten.
